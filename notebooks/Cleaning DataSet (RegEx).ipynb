COFER1 The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, Pennsylvania Clustering in free recall has often been interpreted as arising from use of the category name as a coding response. Data relevant to this interpretation are presented and inter- preted with regard to three free-recall situations in which clustering is observed. It is concluded that category names do not play roles in clustering in the category-clustering situation or in the difference in clustering found for sets of words which comprise all the items of a category as compared with word sets which do not exhaust a category. How- ever, there is evidence that the greater clustering found for categorized pair members than for noncategorized pair members with equal associative overlap may be due to the greater codability of the categorized pairs. Several investigators (Gonzalez and Cofer, 1959; Cohen, 1963a, 1963b; Miller, 1956) have suggested that the reorganization of words in the recall of randomly presented categorized or associated words, which is known as clustering in free recall, and the augmentation of word recall which generally accompanies this reorganization are evidences for coding processes in this situation. Typi- cally, the argument has been that the category names, in the case of word lists made up of items from (usually) four categories, serve as a code. Remembering these category names enables the S readily tO reproduce at recall a large number of the instances; in doing so, he emits related items together, thus displaying clustering. * Symposium on Coding and Conceptual Processes in Verbal Learning, held at the meetings of the American Psychological Association, Los Angeles, Sept., 1964. 1 This is Technical Report No. 4 under Contract Nonr 656(30) between the Office of Naval Research and the Pennsylvania State University. Acknowledg- ment is made to John A. Robinson for the use of his class to obtain the new data reported in the paper and to Elmer Davidson and Darryl Bruce who tabulated the data. In this paper, I shall summarize the results of several experiments and some new data which bear upon this interpretation. In the discussion of these materials, it will be helpful if I first define some terms and sketch more fully some aspects of possible coding opera- tions in the clustering situation. As to terms, the following definitions will be useful. In the first place, category cluster- ing refers to the use of lists composed of items which belong to one or the other of (usually) four mutually exclusive categories, such as animals, occupations, weapons and articles of clothing. High-frequency lists (HF) are lists of this kind which are made up of high-fre- quency associates of these category names and low-frequency lists (LF) are lists composed of low-frequency associates to the category names. The word frequency here refers to frequency of association, not to Thorndike- Lorge frequency, although the two kinds of frequency are often confounded. Random pre- sentation refers to the presentation of a set of items, like those just mentioned, in a se- quence determined from a table of random numbers. Block presentation means that all items of a category are presented one after 188 CODING PROCESSES 189 another, then the items of another category, and so on. Two associative variables may be identified in this situation. One is the associative strength between the category name and the instances; by definition this is high in HF and low in LF lists. The other associative factor is the strength of the associations among the instances themselves. This is prob- ably higher among HF items than among LF items. In considering clustering and word recall, one might argue that coding by the category name should be enhanced by block presenta- tion. When all the items from a category are presented together, the character of the cate- gory and its name should be more obvious than when the items are randomly arranged. This should be true for both HF and LF lists, and, in fact, when asked, Ss are able to identify the category name equally well after block presentation for both I-IF and LF lists (Cofer, Bruce, and Reicher, in press). What do clustering and word recall look like in HF and LF lists after random and block presenta- tion? Evidence for clustering under these conditions was obtained by Cofer et al. (in press, Exp. III). I-IF and LF lists composed of 40 items, belonging to 4 mutually exclusive categories, were presented, one item at a time by means of a memory drum, a single time to Ss, who, after presentation, were asked to recall (by writing) as many items as they could in any order in which the items occurred to them. Three item-presentation intervals (1, 2, or 4sec) were used in different groups. Block presentation augmented clustering of both lists at each interval, but the interaction between block presentation and list frequency was not significant at immediate re- call. However, the tendency to an interaction which was present showed greater augmentation of cluster- ing in the HF than in the LF list, and a possible ceiling effect in the case of the HF list (maximum clustering for the words recalled) probably obscured this interaction if it is present. For word recall, however, the interaction was clear. Here block pre- sentation clearly augments recall for the HF list but has little effect for this measure in the LF list. (These data are shown in Figs. 1 and 2 in the paper by Cofer et al., in press.) Now if the category name is equally avail- able in the HF and LF lists under block pre- sentation, as there is reason to believe that it is, then the differences between the two lists in clustering and word recall would seem to be dependent on other factors, for example, the associative possibilities I have already suggested. It is even possible than S does not use the category name at all. If he recalls a few of the instances he could easily associate others, in the case of the HF list, and perhaps less readily in the case of the LF list. The resulting clustering and word recall could well come out, on this basis, as they do. We have other evidence that without inter-word asso- ciations (Cofer and Bruce, 1965) cate- gorized words do not cluster under random presentation and not much under block presentation. In this experiment, the catego- ries were parts of speech (nouns, adjectives, and verbs), and the items were clear-cut in- stances of each category. College students can classify these items as to part of speech with great accuracy. However, there was little evi- dence that the Ss in the recall experiment actually perceived or used these categories. Let me turn now to some data of Cohen's. Cohen (1963a, 1963b) has compared recall for lists of categorized words which were of two types. In one case, the categories were exhaustive and were composed of either three or four words: blonde, brunette, and redhead form an exhaustive 3-word category, and north, south, east, and west from an exhaus- tive 4-word category. Suitable sets of three words and of four words were developed for the nonexhaustive cases. Cohen found that the exhaustive categories were recalled better and clustered more, on the average, than the nonexhanstive catego- ries. However, he found that the number of categories represented in recall (defined as the occurrence in recall of at least one word from the category) did not differentiate the two kinds of categories. Deese's (1959) measure of inter-item associative strength (I.I.A.S.) 190 COFER clearly showed higher values for the exhaus- tive than for the nonexhaustive sets and cor- related highly with word recall and clustering. It did not correlate with the number of cate- gories recalled, however. Cohen's associative data, which he kindly lent me, were analyzed, in an exploratory way, by means of two measures of association which differ from Deese's measure of inter-item associative strength. Both are described by Marshall and Cofer (1963). One is the Index of Total Association which includes all of the associations which any two words of a set have in common as a proportion of all of the associations the words of the set elicit. The other is the Index of Concept Cohesiveness, which takes account of all those associations elicited in common by all of the words in the set. Neither of these measures was successful in predicting the number of categories recalled by Cohen's Ss. These measures, as well as I.I.A.S., are based on single-word free associations to each item in relative isolation and therefore may not be adequate to Cohen's situation. I have therefore obtained data on some of Cohen's sets in the following way. A test was constructed in which S is asked, for a group of words presented as a group (such as blonde, brunette and redhead), to write a word or phrase which can relate or link the words together. We have tabulated the results from 50 Ss for five of Cohen's 3-word exhaustive, five 3-word nonexhaustive, five 4-word exhaustive and five 4-word nonexhaustive sets, selected more or less at random. The hypothesis was that, in accordance with Glanzer and Clark's (1963, 1964) verbal-loop hypothesis, the exhaustive cate- gory sets should yield more agreement among Ss in the linking words written down, and that perhaps the length of the linking words or phrases would be shorter for them than for the nonexhaustive category sets. This would suggest that the exhaustive sets are more codable than the nonexhaustive sets. For the 3-word sets, the results are the opposite of this hypothesis. For the five exhaustive 3-word sets the mean number of different responses is 21, whereas for the 3-word nonexhaustive sets it is 10.4. The 4-word sets yield results in the other direction and the differences are of about the same size. Thus the 4-word exhaustive sets give a mean of 10.6 different responses, the nonexhaustive sets a mean of 17.8. Mean length of response differs only slightly for exhaustive and nonexhaustive sets, the direction of the differences being again reversed for three- and four-word sets (6.60, Exhaustive, 3-word; 6.04, Non- exhaustive, 3 word; 5.88, Exhaustive, 4-word; 6.16, Nonexhaustive, 4-word). The frequencies of the most common responses, of course, follow the trends in the number of different responses. These data and the analyses by means of the two indices mentioned before do not sug- gest to me a consistent relation between coding responses and the facilitation of recall and clustering in the exhaustive as compared to the nonexhaustive category sets. My guess is that the augmented recall and clustering of the items in the exhaustive sets is entirely due to their high inter-item associative strengths. Recalling one item leads to the other items in the set through the strong associative net- works (and Cohen's demonstration of the \"some or none\" recall of sets in the present symposium supports this interpretation). Why the number of categories recalled should not differ between exhaustive and non- exhaustive sets is not explicable on the basis of associative and coding factors so far as we have explored them to date. My analyses of category clustering and of recall in the case of exhaustive and nonex- haustive sets of words suggest that coding, in the sense of the category name, is not a pro- cess necessary to postulate to account for the data obtained under the conditions summa- rized. However, there are other data on clus- tering, obtained under conditions in which associative factors are equated, which may be responsive to a coding interpretation. Let me discuss these data before concluding. In an unpublished dissertation, Marshall (1963) studied the clustering of pairs of words and cluster- ing of sets of 4 words. Pairs were divided into those in which both members of a pair fell into a common category (like spider-beetle) and those in which the pair members were not so easily categorized (like mountain-high), referred to as categorized and non- categorized pairs, respectively. The pairs were matched for associative overlap (mutual relatedness or MR index) to determine whether categorization would have an effect on clustering and recall, inde- pendent of association. In the recall experiments, the words were randomized (with some restrictions) and recalled in any order. The MR index is a measure, for a pair of words, which takes account of all the associations elicited in common by the two members of the pair (Marshall and Cofer, 1963). CODING PROCESSES 191 Marshall's experiments involved the presentation of lists of 24 words, one at a time, orally. The Ss wrote their recalls under instructions for free recall. A typical list contained words from 6 categorized and 6 noncategorized pairs, and clustering was scored for the re-pairing during recall of pair members which had been separated at list presentation. Clus- tering was compared for the categorized and non- categorized pair members over a wide range of MR values. The data show that the categorized items cluster significantly more than the noncategorized items, especially at intermediate levels of MR. Word recall is somewhat better, also, for the categorized than for the noncategorized items (see Fig. 10 in Cofer, 1965, for a presentation of these data for the clustering measure). Sheer number of inter-word associations cannot account for the differences in clustering or word recall for categorized and noncategorized items since, at any MR level, the two kinds of pairs have equal associative overlaps. However, I have examined other aspects of old associative data and have obtained new data for the two kinds of pairs in the range of MR values where clustering differences appear (MR levels from zero to 29.9) in an attempt to find differences. The first analysis is based on single-word free- associations to the isolated words. Here is what this analysis shows. For the sets of categorized and non- categorized pairs sampled, there are more different responses in common between two categorized pair members and the category name is often a common associate, though not always. For example, the cate- gory names bird, tool, and water account for 86, 20, and 67%, respectively, of the associative overlap between the pair members in the following pairs: eagle-crow, hammer=chisel, ocean-lake. This is not. so true of other categorized pairs like baby-child, violin-harp, and loot-knee; in the last of these, for example, body accounts for only 2% of the overlap. The noncategorized pairs do not show overlap through an associated category name, as, of course, by definition they cannot. Although this analysis from associations to single words does show differ- ences between categorized and noncategorized word pairs, we collected additional data to secure more information. The second analysis is based on data obtained from Ss who saw each pair as a pair and were asked to write a relating or linking word or phrase. There are no systematic differences in number of different words written, the frequency of the most common response, or length of responses so far as the MR levels are concerned. However, the C and NC dis- tinction is paralleled in these data, as Table 1 shows, TABLE 1 MEAN\" NI.~I~BER OF DIFFERENT RESPONSES AND MEAN FREQUENCY OF POPULAR RESPONSES Different Frequency of responses popular responses MR C NC C NC O- 5 18.1 24.5 20.7 10.1 5- 9.9 18.0 26.5 18.5 13.1 10-19.9 15.8 25.5 22.0 13.4 20-29.9 17.8 27.0 19.7 11.8 by differences in the number of different responses and in the frequency of the most popular response. Length of response does not differentiate the C from the NC pairs. As the table indicates, there is a smaller number of different responses and the fre- quency of the popular response is higher for cate- gorized than for noncategorized pairs. The failure of these measures to differentiate among MR levels (and MR is a powerful factor in clustering and word recall) suggests the importance of the associative linkage between the words. How- ever, the results just shown in Table 1 suggest that the categorized items are more codable; i.e., there is more agreement in the words given to link the items, as reflected in the smaller number of words given to the categorized pairs and the higher frequencies of their populars. Coding, then, is perhaps the factor responsible for the augmented clustering and recall shown by the categorized word pairs. I mentioned, also, that Marshall studied 4-word sets. He varied, in such sets, the index of total asso- ciation and the index of concept cohesiveness. For a moderate level of ITA, the index of concept cohe- siveness produces an effect on clustering (it also affects word recall). It is of interest to examine the number of different words and the frequencies of the populars given by Ss asked to provide a linking word for each set of four words for the three levels of ICC at moderate ITA. Again we find a relation- ship. For the two low ICC sets the number of dif- ferent responses is 61, for the two intermediate ICC sets, it is 43, and for the two high ICC sets, it is 15. Clearly, as ICC rises, the number of different link- ing words declines. The frequency of the populars, of course, goes up with ICC: from 16 at low, 39 at intermediate, to 72 at high ICC. Again, length of response is not related to ICC differences. In this paper, I have analyzed three differ- ent free-recall situations in terms of whether a coding response, in the sense of a category name, may be inferred with some legitimacy. My conclusions are that in the four-category 192 COFER list, initially studied by Bousfield, it is prob- able that associations are the dominant factors in clustering and word recall observed; coding by the category name seems fninor, or un- likely, in terms of the analyses made. Simi- larly, in Cohen's work with exhaustive and nonexhaustive categories, associative factors, rather than category names, seem to account for the variance observed. However, in Mar- shall's studies of clustering and recall of cate- gorized and noncategorized pairs, and in the work with sets of four words varying in ICC, the operation of a coding factor (in addition to association) seems highly plausible. If Glanzer and Clark's verbal loop hypothesis requires length of coding response to vary, then the results of these studies offer no sup- port for it. If, on the other hand, number of different responses or frequency of the popu- lar is an appropriate index, then Marshall's results fit the hypothesis. One can probably not generalize too far from these analyses, but I think the evidence is consistent with coding by category name in Marshall's case and is not in Cohen's and the 4-category case. Of course, one could argue that the recall of one (George Miller's sug- gestion) or a few of the items in a category constitutes a code which leads to the genera- tion of other items by association. Thus, the notion of coding could be preserved, but it would not be by means of the category name. We should be clear about what possible processes may be called codes and in what situations the codes apply. Clearly, there must bemultiple ways of coding materials, and the category name is but one of them. REFERENCES COFER, C. N. On some factors in the organizational characteristics of free recall. Amer.

       "\"data relevant to this interpretation are presented and inter- preted with regard to three free-recall situations in which clustering is observed.it is concluded that category names do not play roles in clustering in the category-clustering situation or in the difference in clustering found for sets of words which comprise all the items of a category as compared with word sets which do not exhaust a category.how- ever there is evidence that the greater clustering found for categorized pair members than for noncategorized pair members with equal associative overlap may be due to the greater codability of the categorized pairs.several investigators have suggested that the reorganization of words in the recall of randomly presented categorized or associated words which is known as clustering in free recall and the augmentation of word recall which generally accompanies this reorganization are evidences for coding processes in this situation.typi- cally the argument has been that the category names in the case of word lists made up of items from four categories serve as a code.remembering these category names enables the readily reproduce at recall a large number of the instances in doing so he emits related items together thus displaying clustering.acknowledg- ment is made to john robinson for the use of his class to obtain the new data reported in the paper and to elmer davidson and darryl bruce who tabulated the data.in this paper shall summarize the results of several experiments and some new data which bear upon this interpretation.in the discussion of these materials it will be helpful if first define some terms and sketch more fully some aspects of possible coding opera- tions in the clustering situation.as to terms the following definitions will be useful.in the first place category cluster- ing refers to the use of lists composed of items which belong to one or the other of four mutually exclusive categories such as animals occupations weapons and articles of clothing.high-frequency lists are lists of this kind which are made up of high-fre- quency associates of these category names and low-frequency lists are lists composed of low-frequency associates to the category names.the word frequency here refers to frequency of association not to thorndike- lorge frequency although the two kinds of frequency are often confounded.random pre- sentation refers to the presentation of a set of items like those just mentioned in a se- quence determined from a table of random numbers.block presentation means that all items of a category are presented one after <unknown> coding processes <unknown> another then the items of another category and so on.two associative variables may be identified in this situation.one is the associative strength between the category name and the instances by definition this is high in and low in lists.the other associative factor is the strength of the associations among the instances themselves.this is prob- ably higher among items than among items.in considering clustering and word recall one might argue that coding by the category name should be enhanced by block presenta- tion.when all the items from a category are presented together the character of the cate- gory and its name should be more obvious than when the items are randomly arranged.this should be true for both and lists and in fact when asked are able to identify the category name equally well after block presentation for both i-if and lists .what do clustering and word recall look like in and lists after random and block presenta- tion evidence for clustering under these conditions was obtained by cofer al.i-if and lists composed of items belonging to mutually exclusive categories were presented one item at a time by means of a memory drum a single time to who after presentation were asked to recall as many items as they could in any order in which the items occurred to them.block presentation augmented clustering of both lists at each interval but the interaction between block presentation and list frequency was not significant at immediate re- call.however the tendency to an interaction which was present showed greater augmentation of cluster- ing in the than in the list and a possible ceiling effect in the case of the list probably obscured this interaction if it is present.for word recall however the interaction was clear.here block pre- sentation clearly augments recall for the list but has little effect for this measure in the <unknown>  and in the paper by cofer al.in press now if the category name is equally avail- able in the and lists under block pre- sentation as there is reason to believe that it is then the differences between the two lists in clustering and word recall would seem to be dependent on other factors for example the associative possibilities have already suggested.it is even possible than does not use the category name at all.if he recalls a few of the instances he could easily associate others in the case of the list and perhaps less readily in the case of the list.the resulting clustering and word recall could well come out on this basis as they do.we have other evidence that without inter-word asso- ciations cate- gorized words do not cluster under random presentation and not much under block presentation.in this experiment the catego- ries were parts of speech and the items were clear-cut in- stances of each category.college students can classify these items as to part of speech with great accuracy.however there was little evi- dence that the in the recall experiment actually perceived or used these categories.let me turn now to some data of cohen's.cohen has compared recall for lists of categorized words which were of two types.in one case the categories were exhaustive and were composed of either three or four words blonde brunette and redhead form an exhaustive <unknown>  category and north south east and west from an exhaus- tive <unknown>  category.suitable sets of three words and of four words were developed for the nonexhaustive cases.cohen found that the exhaustive categories were recalled better and clustered more on the average than the nonexhanstive catego- ries.however he found that the number of categories represented in recall did not differentiate the two kinds of <unknown>  cofer clearly showed higher values for the exhaus- tive than for the nonexhaustive sets and cor- related highly with word recall and clustering.it did not correlate with the number of cate- gories recalled however.cohen associative data which he kindly lent me were analyzed in an exploratory way by means of two measures of association which differ from deese measure of inter-item associative strength.one is the index of total association which includes all of the associations which any two words of a set have in common as a proportion of all of the associations the words of the set elicit.the other is the index of concept cohesiveness which takes account of all those associations elicited in common by all of the words in the set.neither of these measures was successful in predicting the number of categories recalled by cohen ss.these measures as well as i.i.a.s.are based on single-word free associations to each item in relative isolation and therefore may not be adequate to cohen situation.i have therefore obtained data on some of cohen sets in the following way.a test was constructed in which is asked for a group of words presented as a group to write a word or phrase which can relate or link the words together.we have tabulated the results from for five of cohen <unknown>  exhaustive five <unknown>  nonexhaustive five <unknown>  exhaustive and five <unknown>  nonexhaustive sets selected more or less at random.the hypothesis was that in accordance with glanzer and clark verbal-loop hypothesis the exhaustive cate- gory sets should yield more agreement among in the linking words written down and that perhaps the length of the linking words or phrases would be shorter for them than for the nonexhaustive category sets.this would suggest that the exhaustive sets are more codable than the nonexhaustive sets.for the <unknown>  sets the results are the opposite of this hypothesis.for the five exhaustive <unknown>  sets the mean number of different responses is whereas for the <unknown>  nonexhaustive sets it is <unknown>  <unknown>  sets yield results in the other direction and the differences are of about the same size.thus the <unknown>  exhaustive sets give a mean of <unknown>  different responses the nonexhaustive sets a mean of <unknown>  length of response differs only slightly for exhaustive and nonexhaustive sets the direction of the differences being again reversed for three- and four-word sets .the frequencies of the most common responses of course follow the trends in the number of different responses.these data and the analyses by means of the two indices mentioned before do not sug- gest to me a consistent relation between coding responses and the facilitation of recall and clustering in the exhaustive as compared to the nonexhaustive category sets.my guess is that the augmented recall and clustering of the items in the exhaustive sets is entirely due to their high inter-item associative strengths.recalling one item leads to the other items in the set through the strong associative net- works .why the number of categories recalled should not differ between exhaustive and non- exhaustive sets is not explicable on the basis of associative and coding factors so far as we have explored them to date.my analyses of category clustering and of recall in the case of exhaustive and nonex- haustive sets of words suggest that coding in the sense of the category name is not a pro- cess necessary to postulate to account for the data obtained under the conditions summa- rized.however there are other data on clus- tering obtained under conditions in which associative factors are equated which may be responsive to a coding interpretation.let me discuss these data before concluding.in an unpublished dissertation marshall studied the clustering of pairs of words and cluster- ing of sets of words.pairs were divided into those in which both members of a pair fell into a common category and those in which the pair members were not so easily categorized referred to as categorized and non- categorized pairs respectively.the pairs were

ita.again we find a relation- ship.for the two low icc sets the number of dif- ferent responses is for the two intermediate icc sets it is and for the two high icc sets it is <unknown>  as icc rises the number of different link- ing words declines.the frequency of the populars of course goes up with icc from at low at intermediate to at high icc.again length of response is not related to icc differences.in this paper have analyzed three differ- ent free-recall situations in terms of whether a coding response in the sense of a category name may be inferred with some legitimacy.my conclusions are that in the four-category <unknown> cofer list initially studied by bousfield it is prob- able that associations are the dominant factors in clustering and word recall observed coding
