In machine learning and statistics, classification is the problem of identifying to which of a set of categories (sub-populations) a new observation belongs, 
on the basis of a training set of data containing observations (or instances) whose category membership is known. Examples are assigning a given email to the "spam" or "non-spam" class,
and assigning a diagnosis to a given patient based on observed characteristics of the patient (sex, blood pressure, presence or absence of certain symptoms, etc.) <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_classification">[more]</a>.
