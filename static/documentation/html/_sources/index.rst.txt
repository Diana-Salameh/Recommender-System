Welcome to the Recommender-System Documentation
===============================================

The developed recommender system is part of our master thesis. Based on the challenge that Data Science is an highly interdisciplinary field of research. This area combines complex methods of statistics, mathematics, computer science and machine learning. Nevertheless, the handling of domain-specific data requires comprehensive domain knowledge. The developed application tries to close the gap between data scientist and domain experts. On the one hand the access to the domain specific topic is simplified for the data scientist and on the other hand the domain expert has an first point of reference for a more comprehensive discussion with the data scientist.

Therefore this package is divided in the Subpackes "core" and "helper" with different subpackages and submodules.
