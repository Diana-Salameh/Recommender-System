The last two years the hospital collected health data about the pattern diseases and medication of their patients. In the future new patterns should be extracted by machine learning algorithms, to identify promising new medication approaches. The goal of the project is to find not discovered associations or frequent pattern yet, which then can be used in promising new medication approaches.
