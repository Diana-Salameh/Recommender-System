n this project, you are given a set of 100-dimensional points and you are asked to discover the hidden structure (if any) behind them. In order to do that, you will apply clustering algorithms like the ones we saw in class, and provide a label for each point. That label will be the coordinates of the representative of the cluster to which the point belongs. You will be evaluated based on the distance of your proposed label from the actual one.
