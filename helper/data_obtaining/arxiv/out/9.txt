Using the APM cluster data we investigate whether the dynamical status of
 clusters is related to the large-scale structure of the Universe. We find that
 cluster substructure is strongly correlated with the tendency of clusters to be
 aligned with their nearest neighbour and in general with the nearby clusters
 that belong to the same supercluster. Furthermore, dynamically young clusters
 are more clustered than the overall cluster population. These are strong
 indications that cluster develop in a hierarchical fashion by anisotropy
 merging along the large-scale filamentary superclusters within which they are
 embedded.
